# Single-Nuclei RNA-Seq Analysis of Aged Skeletal Muscle
## Overview
This project explores the molecular mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle aging and sarcopenia using single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). By analyzing transcriptomic changes in young, aged, and sarcopenic individuals, we identify key genes and pathways involved in muscle degeneration.

## Key Findings
1. Increased expression of MYH8 and PDK4 in aged muscle suggests metabolic shifts and fiber composition changes.
2. Downregulation of IGFN1 indicates impaired muscle regeneration.
3. Presence of CDKN1A-expressing nuclei suggests cellular senescence in aged muscle.
4. Pathway enrichment analysis highlights mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and neurogenic atrophy as contributors to sarcopenia.
## Data Processing Pipeline
1. Preprocessing: Quality control, trimming, alignment, and quantification.
2. Normalization & Clustering: SCTransform normalization, PCA, and UMAP visualization.
3. Differential Expression Analysis: Identification of aging-associated genes and pathways.
## Future Directions
1. Testing therapeutic interventions targeting metabolic and senescence pathways.
2. Longitudinal studies to track muscle aging progression.
3. Higher-resolution single-cell analysis for deeper insights.

This study provides a foundation for developing interventions to combat age-related muscle degeneration.
